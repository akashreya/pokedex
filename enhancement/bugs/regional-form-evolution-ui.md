# Enhancement/Bug: Regional Form Evolution Display

## Summary

The evolution UI should properly handle and display regional variants and their specific evolution paths. Currently, regional forms are not visually distinguished in the evolution chain, and their unique evolution paths may not be clearly shown.

## Desired Behavior

- Add visual indicators (e.g., region icons, background colors) to distinguish regional variants in the evolution chain.
- When viewing a regional form, display its specific evolution path, even if it differs from the standard form's evolution path.
- Handle cases where evolutions change type or appearance based on region.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Regional forms are visually distinct in the evolution UI.
- The correct evolution path is shown for regional forms.
- No regressions for standard forms or other edge cases.

## Notes

- This is a future enhancement and is not required for the current milestone.
- See Task 14, Subtask 4 for original requirements.
